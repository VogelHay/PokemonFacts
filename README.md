As a novice in Python and programming at large, there's a mountain of concepts I have to learn in time. This program is intended to help me better understand three primary key concepts I've wanted to explore in coding:
  1. Communicating with APIs - This program uses PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) to pull information on a desired pokemon, generating a dictionary with all of the pokemon's related information.
  2. List/Dictionary Comprehension - Using list comprehension, it seperates this response into an array of key/value pairs. This is used by the user to select categories that they are interested in learning more about regarding their selected pokemon
  3. Writing to Files - The program takes the dictionary response from PokeAPI and generates a list from the result, storing it in a file to be referenced by the program when needed. Still not 100% sure if this step is necessary, but still a concept
     I wished to review nonetheless.

Due to my inexperience, any and all help related to help fix the program would be greatly appreciated. Code optimizations are also useful since I'm mostly tossing together my pre-existing knowledge with Google results to help scrap together this program.
